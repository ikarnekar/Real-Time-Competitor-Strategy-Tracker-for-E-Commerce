Project Overview

This project equips e-commerce businesses with a real-time competitive intelligence tool. It offers valuable insights by monitoring competitor pricing, discount strategies, and customer sentiment. The solution leverages:

Machine Learning: Predictive modeling with ARIMA for forecasting competitor discounts.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment analysis of customer reviews using Hugging Face Transformers.
Integrations: Slack notifications for real-time updates (optional - you can choose to implement this later).
Key Features

Competitor Data Aggregation: Track competitor product prices and discount strategies over time (automated data collection using web scraping).
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer reviews to understand customer perception towards competitor products.
Predictive Modeling: Forecast future competitor pricing and discount trends using ARIMA models.
Interactive Dashboard: View insights through an easy-to-use Streamlit web application.
Slack Integration: Receive real-time notifications on competitor activity and product changes directly in your Slack channel.
Benefits

Real-Time Insights: Gain a competitive edge by monitoring competitors in real-time and adjusting strategies quickly.
Data-Driven Decisions: Make informed decisions based on deeper insights into customer sentiment and competitor strategies.
Proactive Response: Respond proactively to market shifts by tracking competitor discounts and price changes.
Easy to Use: Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for data visualization and interaction.
Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language for data analysis, machine learning, and app development.
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web dashboards.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis of competitor and review data.
Beautiful Soup & Requests: Web scraping libraries for collecting competitor data from e-commerce websites (consider using a headless browser like Selenium for more robust scraping).
Hugging Face Transformers: Pre-trained models for sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
ARIMA: Time series forecasting method for predicting future pricing and discount trends.
Slack API: Allows sending automated notifications to Slack channels (requires creating a Slack app).
Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Time-Competitor-Strategy-Tracker.git
cd Real-Time-Competitor-Strategy-Tracker
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare Data:

Create competitor_data.csv to store competitor product URLs, IDs, and historical pricing/discount data (you can start with sample data).
Create reviews.csv to store sample customer reviews for sentiment analysis (you can find sample datasets online).
Configure API Keys (Optional):

If you choose to implement Slack notifications, you'll need a Slack app and its Webhook URL.
Consider using a free Groq account for basic strategic recommendations (optional).
Run the Application:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
The Streamlit app will open in your browser.
